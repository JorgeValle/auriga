# Endgame

## At a glance

Endgame is a React(v.16) chess app that is styled mostly with CSS grid. As a playful and frontline project, I am unconcerned with making it compatible with most browsers, although [CSS grid support is improving](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid).

## Running the project

Please note, the project is currently under development, and far from its final functionality.

Download the source, navigate to the root, and start the React app as you normally would.

`
npm start
`

If it doesn't work, try installing all packages first.

`
npm install
`

App can then be found at http://localhost:3000
