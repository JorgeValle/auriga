# Auriga

As a kid, I grew up playing a lot of RPG and strategy games. Far and away they were my favorite games. They still are. Games like [Dragon Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Force), [Final Fantasy Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Tactics) and [Tactics Ogre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactics_Ogre:_Let_Us_Cling_Together) have a special place in my heart.

Euler's Quest is a visual language for an imaginary (or yet to be developed?) role-playing and strategy game. It is a series of user interface elements typically found in RPGs. Stuff like character profiles, item descriptions and dialogue components - all working together to create the style of a medieval, mathematically-themed western world.

It's inspired by a lot of older games, but it's built using pretty modern CSS techniques and React components.

## At a glance

Euler's Quest is a React(v.16) app that is styled mostly with CSS grid. As a playful and frontline project, I was unconcerned with making it compatible with most browser, although [CSS grid support is improving](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid).

## Running the project

Download the source, navigate to the root, and start the React app as you normally would.

`
npm start
`

If it doesn't work, try installing all packages first.

`
npm install
`

App can then be found at http://localhost:3000
